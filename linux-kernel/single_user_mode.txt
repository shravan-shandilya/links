Using /bin/bash as the init program:
1. Pass init as command line arguement to kernel
  init=/bin/bash
2. Lot of things are not done yet(since we changed the init program with bash shell)
  #mount                  (check for mounts if / is not mounted,mount it)
  #fdisk -l               (to list partition table)
  #vi /etc/fstab          (look at fstab to get more info)
  #mount /dev/sd<a/b> /   (Mount on /)
3.Do whatever you want. (theres no limit to the imagination)


Boot direclty into Single user mode:
1.On grub prompt,hit "e" to edit boot args.
2.Find the line having information about kernel.
3.Add "single" to the line and boot
4.This will be usefull if grub is not secured by a password(which was the case when I last tried with ubuntu 14.04).
5.After boot you might directly enter as root user.If not first method is supposed to work.
6.Do whatever you want.

If any of this doesnot work,I would be very glad.
